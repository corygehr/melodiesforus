	<li><strong>Purpose of the Study:</strong>&nbsp; We aim to study music purchasing behaviors.</li>
	<li><strong>Procedures to be followed:</strong>&nbsp; To complete this study, you will be given $1.50 with which you have to purchase the <b>single</b> song from a music store. In the store, you may sample the songs and interact with the shopping environment. Afterwards, you will fill out a survey questionnaire.</li>
	<li><strong>Duration/Time:</strong> The whole process should take you about 10-15 minutes on average.</li>
	<li><strong>Statement of Confidentiality:</strong> Your participation in this research is confidential. In the event of a publication or presentation resulting from the research, no personally identifiable information will be shared.</li>
	<li><strong>Right to Ask Questions:</strong> Please contact Alan Nochenson at anochenson@psu.edu with questions or concerns about this study.</li>
	<li><strong>Payment for participation:</strong> For this study, we have given to you (in addition to the participation reward) a starting budget of $1.50. Using this budget, you have to purchase exactly one song in the music store. Any transaction in the shopping environment reduces your starting budget as described in the shopping environment. At the end of the study, you will receive any remaining money as a bonus payment. </li>
