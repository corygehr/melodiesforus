Thank you for visiting the HIT page for this study. Through your participation, you will receive a participation reward of $0.50 and may qualify for a considerable bonus payment. You must have Javascript enabled to participate in this task.
</p><p>
In the study, you will be visiting an online shopping environment for music. Please take the opportunity to sample the different songs and interact with the website.
</p><p>
For this study, we have given to you (in addition to the participation reward) a starting budget of $1.50. Using this budget, you have to purchase exactly one song in the music store. Any transaction in the shopping environment reduces your starting budget as described in the shopping environment. At the end of the study, you will receive any remaining money as a bonus payment.
 </p><p>
After completing your shopping, you will be redirected to a clearly marked survey. The careful completion of the survey and the submission of the HIT marks the end of the study. There is no completion code. Additionally, you can provide feedback in the box below.
